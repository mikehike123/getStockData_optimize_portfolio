Of course. This is the perfect way to document the project, both for your own reference and for anyone else who might use it. Here is a comprehensive README.md file that explains the tools, the process, and a detailed use case.

Portfolio Optimization and Analysis Toolkit
1. Overview

This project is a complete, end-to-end Python toolkit for performing sophisticated portfolio analysis based on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). It allows a user to take a list of available investment options (such as public ETFs or 401k funds), define specific financial goals, and find the mathematically optimal asset allocation to achieve those goals with the minimum possible risk.

The toolkit is designed to be flexible and handle real-world scenarios, including creating proxies for non-public funds, applying minimum allocation constraints, and batch-processing multiple scenarios to easily compare the trade-offs between different investment strategies.

2. Core Features

Data Preparation: Automatically downloads and cleans historical price data for any list of public tickers (stocks or ETFs).

Custom Fund Proxies: Includes scripts to generate synthetic, compatible data files for non-public funds, such as:

Blended "balanced" funds (e.g., a 60/40 stock/bond mix).

Fixed-income or stable value funds with a fixed annual return.

Mean-Variance Optimization: The core engine uses the Nobel Prize-winning Mean-Variance model to find the "Efficient Frontier" for a given set of assets.

Flexible Constraints: The optimizer can be configured with multiple real-world constraints:

A specific target annual return.

The inclusion of a risk-free asset (like cash or a money market fund).

Minimum allocation percentages for one or more specific assets.

Scenario Analysis: The main script is designed to run multiple scenarios in a single batch, making it easy to compare different strategies (e.g., Conservative vs. Moderate).

Comprehensive Reporting: For each scenario, the toolkit automatically generates:

A detailed text summary of the optimal allocation and key metrics.

A plot showing the historical growth of a hypothetical investment.

A table of the portfolio's historical annual returns.

The portfolio's maximum drawdown (a key risk measure).

A master .csv file comparing the key results from all scenarios, perfect for spreadsheet analysis.

3. The Python Toolkit

This project consists of two primary scripts and several optional diagnostic tools.

Main Scripts

prepare_all_data_for_optimizer.py

Purpose: This is the starting point for any analysis. It is a master script that creates a clean, perfectly synchronized dataset for the optimizer.

What it does:

Deletes any old data to ensure a fresh start.

Downloads 20 years of monthly historical data for all specified public tickers (e.g., SPY, BA).

Programmatically generates CSV files for custom "proxy" funds (e.g., a Boeing Balanced Fund, a Boeing Stable Value Fund).

Fixes all date and timezone alignment issues to ensure every file is 100% compatible.

When to use: Run this script once at the beginning of your analysis or anytime you need to add a new asset or update your data.

optimize_portfolio_allocations.py

Purpose: This is the main analysis engine. It takes the data prepared by the previous script and runs the optimization scenarios.

What it does:

Reads all the data files from the data directory.

Loops through a user-defined list of scenarios.

For each scenario, it runs the optimizer with the specified target return and constraints.

Generates all the output reports (text summaries, plots, and the final comparison CSV).

When to use: This is the script you will run most often. You will edit the SCENARIOS_TO_RUN section at the top of this file to define your experiments and then execute it to see the results.

Diagnostic Scripts (For Debugging)

check_dates.py: Checks the start and end dates of all CSV files in the data directory.

check_missing_data.py: Checks for "holes" (missing NaN values) inside the data files.

4. Installation and Setup

To use this toolkit, you need a functioning Python environment. The recommended approach is to use Anaconda.

Open the Anaconda Prompt (or Terminal on Mac/Linux).

Create a new, clean environment. This avoids any conflicts with other projects. We will name it yfinance_fresh_env.

Generated bash
conda create --name yfinance_fresh_env python=3.11 pandas scipy numpy matplotlib


Activate the new environment. You must do this every time you open a new terminal to work on this project.

Generated bash
conda activate yfinance_fresh_env
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Install yfinance. This library is used to download the market data.

Generated bash
pip install yfinance
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

You are now ready to use the toolkit.

5. Use Case: Analyzing a 401k Plan

This walkthrough describes the entire process of using the toolkit to analyze a real-world scenario, such as advising a spouse on their 401k options.

Step 1: The Goal

The objective is to find the best way to allocate my wife's 401k savings. We want to compare two strategies: a conservative portfolio targeting a 5% annual return and a moderate one targeting 7%. Her plan has specific investment options and requires us to hold a minimum in certain funds.

Step 2: Identify the Funds and Their Proxies

We look at her 401k plan and list the available investment options. Since they don't have public ticker symbols, we find the closest public ETF proxy for each.

401k Fund Name	Fund Type	Public Proxy
Boeing Stock Fund	Single Stock	BA
US Equity Index Fund	S&P 500	SPY
Boeing Balanced Fund	70% Stock / 30% Bond	Custom: BOEING_BALANCED_70_30
Boeing Stable Value	Fixed Income	Custom: BOEING_Stable_2_84 (2.84% return)
(Other available funds)	(e.g., Nasdaq, International, Gold)	QQQ, EFA, GLD
Step 3: Prepare All Data

Before we can run the analysis, we need to create a clean, synchronized dataset.

Open the prepare_all_data.py script.

Ensure the public_tickers list includes all the necessary proxies ('SPY', 'BA', 'QQQ', etc.).

Ensure the custom fund sections are configured correctly for the balanced and stable value funds.

Run the script from your activated conda environment:

Generated bash
python prepare_all_data.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This will create the stock_data_yfinance folder and populate it with perfectly aligned CSV files for all the required assets.

Step 4: Define the Scenarios in the Optimizer

Now we open the main script, optimize_portfolio_allocations.py, to define our experiment. We edit the SCENARIOS_TO_RUN list at the top of the file.

Generated python
SCENARIOS_TO_RUN = [
    {
        'name': 'Wife_401k_Conservative_5_Pct',
        'target_return': 0.05,
        'constraints': {
            'SPY': 0.13,
            'BOEING_Stable_2_84': 0.13,
            'BOEING_BALANCED_70_30': 0.03,
            'BA': 0.02
        }
    },
    {
        'name': 'Wife_401k_Moderate_7_Pct',
        'target_return': 0.07,
        'constraints': {
            'SPY': 0.13,
            'BOEING_Stable_2_84': 0.13,
            'BOEING_BALANCED_70_30': 0.03,
            'BA': 0.02
        }
    }
]
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

We also ensure the risk_free_rate is set correctly (e.g., to match the current money market rate).

Step 5: Run the Optimization

With the scenarios defined, we execute the script from our terminal:

Generated bash
python optimize_portfolio_allocations.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

The script will now loop through each scenario, run the optimization, and generate all the reports.

Step 6: Analyze the Results

The final step is to review the output to make a decision.

Individual Reports: We look inside the reports/ folder. We will find two new subdirectories: Wife_401k_Conservative_5_Pct/ and Wife_401k_Moderate_7_Pct/. Each contains a detailed summary_report.txt and a portfolio_growth_chart.png. We can review these to understand each strategy in depth.

The Comparison Summary: The most powerful output is the reports/scenarios_comparison_summary.csv file. We open this in Excel or Google Sheets. It gives us a clear, side-by-side comparison of the two strategies, showing the trade-offs in volatility, potential downside (max drawdown, 95% confidence), and performance during the 2008 stress test.

Based on this comparison, we can have an informed discussion with my wife about which portfolio's risk/return profile she is more comfortable with, and then implement the recommended allocation in her 401k account.

This end-to-end workflow provides a data-driven, systematic, and repeatable process for making complex investment decisions.
